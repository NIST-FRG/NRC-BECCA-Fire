\newcommand{\pubabstract}{This report documents a series of fire experiments performed within steel electrical enclosures and on open ``ladder back'' cable trays. The first objective is to measure the heat release rates and qualitatively understand the burning behavior of circuit breaker fires within closed steel enclosures when ignited by a source representative of a high energy arc fault (HEAF). The second objective of this report is to quantify the thermal exposure of electrical cables that typically are installed in trays above an enclosure.  }
