\section{Introduction}

Electrical switchgear enclosures housing equipment such as circuit breakers and motor controls are a common source of fire in industrial settings, and the heat release rate (HRR) and damage caused by these fires are important considerations in facility risk assessments. This report describes measurements of the HRR of circuit breakers within electrical enclosures as well as the internal temperature of electrical cables and other equipment outside of the enclosure exposed to the heat of fires within.

Previous experiments have been conducted to determine HRR probability distributions for electrical enclosure fires~\cite{NUREG/CR-7197}. Analysis was then conducted to refine these results to consider specific electrical enclosure characteristics (e.g., classifying electrical enclosures in terms of function, size, contents/fuel loading, and ventilation)~\cite{NUREG-2178}. In 2020, a revised set of parameters was provided~\cite{NUREG2230} to address both the fire growth and the suppression response. Further experiments were conducted to measure the HRR for enclosures with limited ventilation~\cite{OLIVE-FIRE} and to quantify the impact of material composition (of combustible solids commonly found in power plants) on ignitability and fire growth behavior~\cite{leventon2024nist}.

To date, there are few measurements\footnote{See Reference~\cite{NEA_HEAF_2017} which includes a description of some experiments in which the HRR of a fire initiated by a high energy arc fault was measured.} of the HRR of circuit breaker fires in electrical enclosures, which have been observed to grow and continue burning for tens of minutes after high energy arc fault (HEAF) events. Thus, the experiments described in this report (Section~\ref{Sec:Circuit Breakers}) seek to quantify the peak HRR, time to peak HRR, and duration of circuit breaker fires in steel electrical enclosures. The second focus of this report (Section~ \ref{Sec:Cables}) summarizes the results of experiments designed to quantify the thermal exposure of electrical cables that typically are installed in trays above an enclosure.

The experiments described in this report are part of a broader test series, hence the first experiment presented is identified as Experiment 33. Results from the earlier 32 experiments are presented in NIST Technical Note~2232~\cite{OLIVE-FIRE}.

Also, the uncertainty of a measurement presented in this report is typically expressed as a relative expanded uncertainty, sometimes referred to as a 95~\% or ``two-sigma'' confidence interval. This uncertainty includes both an {\em epistemic} component, i.e. the measuring device has an accuracy and precision reported by the manufacturer based on its operating principles and calibration, and an {\em aleatoric} component, i.e. there are random variations in repeated trials of an experiment.

\section{A Surrogate Target for Assessing Electrical Cables Exposed to Fire}
\label{cable_surrogate}

The objective of experiments involving fires within electrical enclosures is not necessarily to assess the viability of the enclosure itself or the equipment contained within, but rather to assess the vulnerability of surrounding equipment and the likelihood of spreading the fire beyond its point of origin. The equipment most likely to be located near an enclosure are electrical cables. The fragility of electrical cables exposed to the heat of a fire is largely a function of the cable's inner temperature; that is, the temperature underneath its protective jacket where the metallic conductors rapidly spread the heat. Of course, electrical failure or ignition do not occur precisely at any one temperature, but research suggests~\cite{CAROLFIRE} that the median failure temperature for most cables is between 200~$^\circ$C and 400~$^\circ$C (392~$^\circ$F and 752~$^\circ$F). It is typically assumed in risk assessments that electrical failure and ignition occur at similar temperatures, most likely because electrical arcing provides an igniting spark.

For the experiments described in this report, it was not possible to include every possible type of cable. This is a common problem in fire science, and it has become common practice to use simple, often metallic, objects to represent a wider range of objects that might be subjected to the heat of a fire. For example, Putorti et al.~\cite{Putorti:SMIRT23} used copper and tungsten disks to assess the thermal flux from enclosures subjected to high energy arc faults (HEAF). For the current experiments, a 6061~aluminum alloy rod, approximately  15~cm (6~in) in length and 13~mm (0.5~in) in diameter has been chosen to represent a cable of comparable diameter. Aluminum has been chosen as the metal because its specific heat is comparable to the bulk specific heat of a typical electrical cable containing a mix of polymers and metal conductors, usually copper.

A useful way to compare the aluminum rod with a cable is by way of its {\em heat capacity}, expressed as the product of the density, specific heat, and cross sectional area, $\rho c A$, in units of kJ/(K~m); that is, the amount of energy required to raise a 1~m segment 1~K. The heat capacity of the aluminum rod is approximately 0.31~kJ/(K~m). This value can be compared to that of the two cables that have been used in the ignition experiments described below. The one referred to as the ``thermoplastic'' cable has polyethylene insulation covering its seven 12~AWG\footnote{American Wire Gauge} copper conductors. Its jacket is approximately 1.9~mm (0.075~in) thick polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The cable is approximately 15.9~mm (0.63~in) in diameter and has a mass of 0.38~kg/m. It is approximately 55~\% by mass copper, 27~\% jacket, 10~\% insulation, and 8~\% filler. Using nominal values of the specific heats of these materials, its thermal capacity is calculated to be approximately 0.36~kJ/(K~m). The cable referred to as the ``thermoset'' has cross-linked polyethylene insulation covering its twelve 18~AWG copper conductors. Its jacket is approximately 1.5~mm (0.06~in) thick chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSPE). The cable is approximately 12.7~mm (0.5~in) in diameter and has a mass of 0.25~kg/m. It is approximately 37~\% by mass copper, 33~\% jacket, 29~\% insulation, and 1~\% filler. Its thermal capacity is approximately 0.22~kJ/(K~m).

Figure~\ref{oven} displays the measured\footnote{Omega Engineering reports that the expanded uncertainty of its Type~K thermocouple is $\pm 0.75$~\% of the measured absolute temperature.} temperature of an aluminum rod and two cables cut into 15~cm (6~in) segments when placed in a convection oven whose temperature is set to a nominal value of 300~$^\circ$C (572~$^\circ$F). A 3~mm (1/8~in) hole was drilled 7.5~cm (3~in) along the central axis of the aluminum rod and a single thermocouple was inserted within. For the cable segments, a small incision was made in the cable jacket and a single thermocouple was inserted between the conductors approximately halfway along its length. The incision was sealed with noncombustible tape.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[height=3.0in]{../SCRIPT_FIGURES/Oven_Test}
\caption[Temperatures of cables and aluminum rod in convective oven]{Measured temperatures of a 13~mm (0.5 in) aluminum rod and two representative cable segments in a convection oven.}
\label{oven}
\end{figure}

The measured temperatures of the rod and cable segments are fairly comparable, suggesting that the aluminum rod mimics the cable segments until the cable polymers begin to pyrolyze at approximately 300~$^\circ$C. However, in the experiments described below, the temperature of the aluminum rod tended to increase at a slightly faster rate than instrumented cables located at the same location. There are several reasons for this. First, the cables were cut into lengths on the order of 3~m to 4~m (9~ft to 12~ft) and placed in a ladder-back cable tray. Only a small fraction of the cable was exposed to the direct heat of the fire plume, and its copper conductors would have distributed the heat along its entire length. The aluminum rod, on the other hand, is cut to a length of 15~cm; thus, the heat is ``trapped'' and does not dissipate laterally. Second, the cables were set next to one another in the tray such that some fraction of the surface area would have been shielded from the convective and radiative heating of the fire. The rods were typically more exposed.

Given that the aluminum rods are not perfect surrogates for cables, why use them at all? It is not difficult to affix thermocouples within unenergized cables, and, indeed, this was done as part of the test protocol. The principal reason for the aluminum rods is to facilitate comparisons with numerical models. Regardless of the level of detail in the underlying physics, fire models typically treat a cable as a cylinder that is heated uniformly at the surface and which undergoes one-dimensional heating in the radial direction. There is no lateral heat conduction and typically there are no nearby obstructions. It is certainly possible to model a tray full of cables using a complex three-dimensional heat conduction algorithm, but such a calculation is time-consuming, difficult to embed within existing models, and requires detailed thermo-physical data of all the cables that might be in a given tray. It is far more tractable to perform a simple one-dimensional heat transfer calculation based on computed conditions in the vicinity of the cable tray. The computed surrogate temperatures can also be easily scaled should the actual cables be larger or smaller in diameter to the nominal 13~mm (0.5~in) chosen in this study.

The temperature measurements described in this report are to be used to validate numerical models that will then be used to consider many other enclosure-cable tray configurations that could not be physically tested. The purpose of this modeling is to predict the thermal conditions in the vicinity of equipment surrounding a burning electrical enclosure. The aluminum rods provide a far better ``target'' with which to assess the model predictions. In essence, the aluminum rod is a device that measures the amount of heat that would be absorbed by an actual cable of comparable diameter. Making this measurement with the cable itself is, ironically, more difficult because of the fact that the cable allows the absorbed heat to be conducted along its length.

\section{Circuit Breaker Heat Release Rate Measurements}
\label{Sec:Circuit Breakers}

Four low-voltage circuit breaker enclosures built by ABB, an international manufacturer of electrical equipment, were shipped to the National Fire Research Laboratory (NFRL) at NIST in September 2023. These enclosures were donated by the German nuclear safety organization Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) from a decommissioned nuclear power plant in Germany, and contain low-voltage circuit breakers and various types of panel wires, cables, and instrumentation. One configuration consisted of three vertical sections that were bolted together, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Cabinet_1}, and one configuration was detached.

\begin{figure}[ht]

Wiring and other electrical equipment is located mainly in the compartment above, and the compartment below is largely empty. Each of the three vertical columns is largely the same.}
\label{fig:Cabinet_1}
\end{figure}

Two additional circuit breaker enclosures, manufactured by Westinghouse, were shipped to NIST in December 2023. Each enclosure houses six low-voltage breakers. One of the enclosures is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Cabinet_2}, where the lowest level breaker has been removed and replaced with a gas burner for the experiment. The uppermost compartment contains wiring and instrumentation.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Description of Experiments}

For the experiments involving either the ABB or Westinghouse enclosures, one or more circuit breakers with nominal dimensions of 30~cm by 40~cm by 30~cm (12~in by 16~in by 12~in) and masses of approximately 50~kg (110~lb) are the primary combustibles whose non-metallic mass consists of polymeric insulating materials such as glass-polyester and thermoset composite resins. Additionally, plastic wire harnesses, panel wire, and circuit boards are located, typically, in the compartment above the breaker, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:Contents}. There are, typically, only a few jacketed, multi-conductor cables located within the upper compartment. In these experiments, some cables were added to the upper compartment to make up for those that were removed prior to shipment to NIST.

The compartment below the breaker is largely devoid of combustible materials. No attempt was made to remove and weigh all of the combustible materials because doing so would have potentially changed its burning behavior. However, representative samples of the most common non-metallic components such as wire insulation, switches, and circuit boards were removed prior to the experiments to determine their heat of combustion (see Section~\ref{ssec:MCC}). Estimates of the total combustible mass in each compartment were then made by dividing the integral of the HRR with time (kJ) by the measured heat of combustion (kJ/kg). These results are presented in Section~\ref{sec:results}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../FIGURES/Contents}
\caption[Photograph of instrumentation above the breaker] {Photograph of instrumentation above the breaker. A few cables have been added to replace those removed previously.}
\label{fig:Contents}
\end{figure}

The breakers were ignited using a nominally 30~cm (12~in) square natural gas burner positioned approximately 20~cm (8~in) beneath the circuit breaker, as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:Cabinet_2} and~\ref{fig:Burner}. The burner's HRR\footnote{The relative expanded uncertainty (95~\% confidence interval) of the HRR measurement under the hood used in these experiments is 4~\% for natural gas and 7~\% for ``generic combustibles''~\cite{bryant2019nist}.} was set to approximately 100~kW. After sustained ignition of the circuit breaker was observed, the burner was turned off and the enclosure fire was allowed to continue burning until the measured HRR decreased below 10~kW, at which point the small remaining fires were extinguished.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../FIGURES/Burner}
\caption[Position of the burner] {Position of the burner under the breaker in Test~34.}
\label{fig:Burner}
\end{figure}

Sheathed thermocouples\footnote{Type K, sheath diameter 3~mm (1/8~in), expanded uncertainty $\pm 0.75$~\% of the measured absolute temperature.} were installed approximately 15~cm (6~in) below the ceiling of each compartment to provide a measurement of the gas temperature within. Thermocouples were also embedded within electrical cable segments and aluminum rods (see Section~\ref{cable_surrogate}) that were placed directly above each circuit breaker. The cable target is a 7-conductor thermoplastic electrical cable segment and the aluminum target is a 6061~aluminum alloy rod, both approximately  15~cm (6~in) in length and 13~mm (0.5~in) in diameter. Throughout this report, these surrogate targets are referred to as slug calorimeters, or simply ``slugs,'' a term commonly used in the fire science community to describe objects such as these.

Photographs of the enclosures used in this project are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:Cabinet_1} and \ref{fig:Cabinet_2}. Each enclosure is approximately 2.2~m (87~in) tall, 0.4~m (16~in) wide, and 1.0~m (40~in) deep. Some of the enclosures have ventilation panels near the top and bottom, and all have seams and small openings to accommodate wiring, bus bars, door panels, and so on. No attempt was made to seal these various gaps and openings except in Experiment~34 where a burned out instrument panel was covered by a steel plate, and in Experiment~35, where a hole in the top of the enclosure was covered by a steel plate.



\subsection{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}

The measurements of the HRR of the breakers were made in October of 2023 and January of 2024. Nominal results are listed in Table~\ref{matrix} and details can be found on the following pages. For each experiment, the nominally 100~kW natural gas burner was sustained until it appeared that the breaker had begun to burn. For the first two experiments, the burner was sustained longer than necessary, as evidenced by Exp.~35 where the breaker was able to sustain a fire after four minutes of exposure from the burner.

Overall, the breakers within the ABB enclosures sustained a fire beyond the time when the burner was extinguished. However, the Westinghouse breakers did not appear to burn without the aid of the gas burner, even though, after the experiment, the non-metallic materials within the breaker clearly showed evidence of having pyrolized. In short, the pyrolysis was not followed by flaming combustion.

The ``Peak HRR'' in Table~\ref{matrix} indicates the maximum value of the HRR of the enclosure contents; that is the total HRR minus that of the natural gas burner. The ``Total HR'' (Total Heat Release) is the total energy released less the burner's energy; that is, the energy of the contents alone. The ``Mass Consumed'' is the Total HR divided by an estimated\footnote{The uncertainty of the estimated heat of combustion is difficult to quantify. The estimated value of 20~MJ/kg $\pm$5~MJ/kg is merely the average heat of combustion, $\Delta H_c$, measured for various plastics found within the enclosure (weighted to account for the greater mass of combustible solids contained within the circuit breaker itself, which had relatively low $\Delta H_c$; see Sec.~\ref{ssec:MCC}).} heat of combustion of 20~MJ/kg for the combustible materials within the enclosure. The peak ``slug'' and gas temperatures are comparable and represent uniform conditions within the burning breaker and instrument compartments.

\end{table}

The breaker that was burned in Exp.~35 was weighed before and after the experiment. Its original mass was 47.8~kg and its final mass was 44.1~kg. The uncertainty of the load cell is approximately 1~g, which is far exceeded by the uncertainty due to extracting the burned breaker from the enclosure and separating out materials that were or were not part of the original breaker. Thus, the estimated combustible mass of the breaker is taken as 3.7~kg~$\pm$~0.1~kg.

Using the measured mass loss of the breaker and the estimates of the mass consumed in the three experiments, it is possible to estimate the distribution of combustible mass in the lower, middle, and upper compartments of the enclosure. In Exp.~33, the fire consumed the contents of a lower, middle and three upper compartments. In Exp.~34, the fire consumed a lower and middle compartment. In Exp.~35, the fire consumed a lower, middle, and upper compartment. Taking the combustible load of the middle compartment to be 3.7~kg, the estimated mass loss of the breaker, a least squares regression yields an estimate of 3.5~kg for the lower compartment and 2.7~kg for the upper. The 3.5~kg estimate for the lower compartment can be taken as all of the combustibles in the lower and middle compartment minus the breaker itself. These estimated combustible loads fall well within the uncertainty bounds for the total mass consumption listed in Table~\ref{matrix}.

The HRR of a fire contained within a single compartment is limited by the air supplied through openings in the back and side of the enclosure and the opening in the front door of the compartment that is created when the instrument panel melts/burns away. For the enclosures tested, this opening is approximately 15~cm (6~in) wide by 30~cm (12~in) tall. A useful correlation~\cite{SFPE:Walton} used in compartment fire modeling states that air is entrained into a flashed over compartment at a rate given by

   \dot{m}_{\rm a} = 0.5  \, A \, \sqrt{H}  \approx 0.0123 \; \hbox{kg/s}
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the opening height (0.3~m) and $A$ is the opening area (0.045~m$^2$). With this estimate, the HRR can be estimated
\begin{equation}
   \dot{Q} = Y_{\rm O_2,\infty} \, E \, \dot{m}_{\rm a} \approx 37 \; \hbox{kW}
\end{equation}
where $Y_{\rm O_2,\infty}\approx 0.23$ is the oxygen mass fraction of air and $E\approx 13\,100$~kJ/kg is the approximate amount of energy released per unit mass of oxygen consumed.

Evidence for the estimated HRR associated with the opening of the instrument panel can be seen in Exp.~35 where the upper compartment opens up at approximately 19~min, at which time the HRR increases rapidly by approximately 40~kW. The increased ventilation through the front door adds to the existing ventilation through the back of the enclosure. Collectively, these openings supply the air needed to support an HRR of approximately 100~kW per compartment.


\subsubsection{Material Property Measurements}
\label{ssec:MCC}

Material samples were taken from the various circuit breakers to better understand their burning behavior using a Microscale Combustion Calorimeter\footnote{This MCC used in this work was a Deatak MCC-3 equipped with a paramagnetic oxygen sensor and calibrated according to ASTM~D7309~\cite{ASTMD7309}} (MCC), an apparatus in which a specimen of known mass is thermally decomposed in nitrogen at a constant heating rate and then burned in oxygen to determine its heat of combustion. Samples were not identified by a specific material type (e.g., composition, and/or manufacturer/distributor name), rather they are labeled in series (No. 1 to No. 10) to correspond to each of the items identified in Fig.~\ref{fig:MCC_samples}.

\end{figure}

MCC experiments were conducted in December, 2023. The material samples were subjected to a 80~mL/min nitrogen stream starting at a temperature of 75~°C, increasing linearly to 750~°C at a heating rate of 60~K/min. The pyrolyzed gases were combusted in an oxygen stream of 20~mL/min. Tests were repeated at least three times for each material. Nominal results are listed in Table~\ref{MCC}. The mass-weighted average heat of combustion of the materials tested is approximately 20~MJ/kg. Also reported in this table are the onset temperature and Fire Growth Capacity, FGC. The FGC is a physically-based parameter for early stage fire growth, derived from a simple burning model, that has been shown to rank commercial materials according to their behavior in bench scale flame and fire tests~\cite{lyon2021molecular}. The onset temperature is approximated by the temperature at which 5~\% of total heat release is measured, consistent with the definition of the FGC. Details of these calculations are provided elsewhere~\cite{DOT/FAA/TC-20/30, lyon2021molecular}.


\begin{table}
\caption[MCC Measurements]{MCC Measurements. The relative expanded uncertainty in the reported Heat of Combustion is approximately 6~\% of the measured value. The primary components of this uncertainty estimate include: (1) the relative expanded uncertainty of the heat released per unit mass of oxygen consumed, 5~\%~\cite{Huggett:1}; (2) the relative expanded uncertainty of the system flow rate, 2~\%; and (3) test repeatability, 2~\% or 2 standard deviations of replicate measurements. The relative expanded uncertainty in the solid residue yield is 2~\%, primarily due to stochastic variations in values measured in repeated tests. The expanded uncertainty of the temperature measurements is $\pm 0.75$~\% of the measured absolute value. }

\subsubsection{Experiment 33}

The HRR and gas/target temperatures are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Test_33}. Referring to the photographs shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Test_33_photos}, the natural gas burner was positioned near the top of the lower left compartment of the enclosure, approximately 20~cm (8~in) below the breaker located in the middle left compartment. The fire ignited the breaker after approximately 2~min and then spread to the compartment above. The fire then spread to the two adjacent compartments along the top of the enclosure. The gas temperatures shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Test_33} indicate that the fire spread from one compartment to the next in approximately 10~min. The compartments are separated by two steel walls.

\subsubsection{Experiment 34}

The fire in Exp.~33 consumed all of the combustibles in the upper compartments of the large enclosure. However, the breakers in the center and right columns remained intact. For Exp.~34, the burner was placed beneath the breaker on the right side of the enclosure (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Test_34_photos}) with the aim of measuring its HRR with no combustibles in the compartment above. The gas temperature in the compartment above reaches only approximately 400~$^\circ$C because there is no significant fire in this compartment, only the heat from the fire below.

The breaker ignited within 4~min at which time the burner was turned off. The total HRR dropped to about 50~kW at this time and then slowly increased as the fire spread from the breaker to the compartment above after approximately 18~min from the start of the experiment.

\section{Thermal Exposure of Cables Above a Burning Electrical Enclosure}
\label{Sec:Cables}
Three types of experiments were conducted to assess the thermal exposure of electrical cables above a burning enclosure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Single trays of cables were positioned above a gas burner.
\item Plume temperatures were measured above vents in a burning electrical enclosure.
\item Cable trays were exposed to fire plumes above burning enclosures.
\end{enumerate}
Two types of cables were used in these experiments. The one referred to as the ``thermoplastic'' cable has polyethylene insulation covering its seven 12~AWG\footnote{American Wire Gauge} copper conductors. Its jacket is approximately 1.9~mm thick polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The cable is approximately 15.9~mm (0.63~in) in diameter and has a mass of 0.38~kg/m. It is approximately 55~\% by mass copper, 27~\% jacket, 10~\% insulation, and 8~\% filler; its thermal capacity is approximately 0.36~kJ/(K~m).

The cable referred to as the ``thermoset'' has cross-linked polyethylene insulation covering its twelve 18~AWG copper conductors. Its jacket is approximately 1.5~mm thick chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSPE). The cable is approximately 12.7~mm (0.5~in) in diameter and has a mass of 0.25~kg/m. It is approximately 37~\% by mass copper, 33~\% jacket, 29~\% insulation, and 1~\% filler; its thermal capacity is approximately 0.22~kJ/(K~m).

\subsection{Single Tray Ignition Study}

In these experiments, a single 45~cm (18~in) wide tray containing either thermoplastic or thermoset cables was positioned above a nominally 30~cm (12~in) square natural gas burner with an HRR of approximately 40~kW. Some of the cables had Type-K thermocouple embedded with an aluminum rod (``slug'') positioned alongside. The purpose of the experiments was two-fold: (1) to provide measurements of internal cable temperature and ignition time, and (2) to assess the use of the aluminum slugs as a surrogate for actual cables in testing of this sort.

\subsubsection{Experiment 45}

A nominally 45~cm (18~in) wide tray containing 34 thermoset cables was placed approximately 36~cm (14~in) above a nominally 30~cm square 40~kW natural gas burner. Thermocouples were inserted into two cables above the burner, and instrumented aluminum rods (``slugs'') were placed alongside the instrumented cables. The figures below show the HRR of the gas burner and the total HRR of the burner and cables, along with the internal temperatures of the cables and slugs. A small flame appeared in one location above the layer of cables at about 50~min, but the flame did not spread or lead to a wider, sustained ignition. Even though the cables did not fully ignite after an exposure of 1~h, but there was extensive damage and exposure of the copper wires.

\subsection{Measuring the Gas Temperature above a Burning Enclosure}

Following the HRR measurements in Experiments 40 and 41, the same Westinghouse enclosure was used in experiments aimed at measuring the fire plume temperature outside of a near-ceiling vertical vent. These were difficult measurements to perform because it is difficult to predict the trajectory of the plume centerline. Nevertheless, it can be seen in Experiments~42 through 45 that temperatures above a vertical vent can reach values of 400~$^\circ$C to 500~$^\circ$C (750~$^\circ$F to 930~$^\circ$F), high enough to ignite cables given enough time, a subject which is the focus of Experiments~49 through 64.



\clearpage


\subsubsection{Experiment 42}

A nominally 30~cm (12~in) square natural gas burner was positioned in the mostly empty space at the rear of the breaker enclosure used in Experiments~40 and 41. The HRR of the burner was ramped up to 200~kW following an approximate t-squared profile. Six sheathed thermocouples were positioned above the upper rear vent in an attempt to measure the plume temperature. The plume did not follow the expected pattern and the tips of the thermocouples were not exposed to the peak temperatures within the plume. Thus, this experiment is of marginal value for assessing the threat to overhead targets.

The figures below show the HRR of the gas burner, along with the temperatures measured by the sheathed thermocouples above the enclosure.

\subsubsection{Experiment 43}

A nominally 30~cm (12~in) square natural gas burner was positioned in the mostly empty space at the rear of the breaker enclosure used in Experiments~40 and 41. The HRR of the burner was ramped up to 300~kW following an approximate t-squared profile. Six aluminum rods (``slugs'') and six sheathed thermocouples were positioned above the upper rear vent in an attempt to measure the plume temperature. Two of each instrument were positioned approximately 15~cm (6~in), 30~cm (12~in), and 60~cm (24~in) above the top of the enclosure, roughly flush with the rear door.

The figures below show the HRR of the gas burner and the total HRR of the burner, along with the temperatures measured by the sheathed thermocouples and aluminum rods above the enclosure. Note that the rod temperatures show less temporal variation because of increased thermal mass. These temperatures are a better indicator of those of actual cables that might be located in the vicinity.

\subsubsection{Experiment 44}

Experiment~44 was similar to Experiment~43 except that two vents in the left rear door of the enclosure were closed off with a metal barrier. The closing of these other vents led to a higher velocity and higher flame heights at the vent above the burner.

The figures below show the HRR of the gas burner, along with the temperatures measured by the sheathed thermocouples and aluminum rods above the enclosure.

\subsection{Measuring Cable Temperatures above an Enclosure Fire}

Experiments 49 through 64, conducted in March 2024, made use of two empty electrical enclosures used in a previous set of experiments~\cite{OLIVE-FIRE}. Drawings are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:enclosure_drawings} through \ref{fig:Cabinet_2_3D_Holes}. One or two 30~cm (12~in) wide cable trays were positioned on top of the enclosures. The trays contained (usually) ten thermoplastic or thermoset cables, some of which were instrumented with a thermocouple embedded in its center amongst the conductors. Aluminum rods (``slugs'') were also placed on top of the cables in the vicinity of the embedded thermocouples. The aluminum rods have a similar thermal mass to the cables, but are more convenient for modeling.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\hspace*{-0.75in}\includegraphics[height=4.5in]{../FIGURES/Cabinet_3}
\hspace*{-1.25in}\includegraphics[height=4.5in]{../FIGURES/Cabinet_1}
\caption[Drawings of Enclosures \#2 and \#3]{Drawings of Enclosure~\#3 (left) and \#2 (right).}
\label{fig:enclosure_drawings}
\end{figure}
Sheathed thermocouples were also positioned above the trays to measure the plume (gas) temperature, but these measurements are of little value because they rarely capture the peak plume temperature or the actual exposing temperature of the cables. The reason is that the plume centerline does not follow a vertical path, but rather jets out of the vent and then turns back towards the enclosure face. The path changes as the fire grows. Initially the fairly weak plume is drawn inwards towards the top of the enclosure, but then extends outwards as the fire grows and the plume temperature increases.

The same 30~cm (12~in) natural gas burner used in previous experiments was positioned in the center of Enclosure~\#3, approximately 1.5~m (60~in) below the ceiling, or below the left vent in Enclosure~\#2, approximately 56~cm (22~in) below the ceiling. The HRR profile was varied, but in all cases it was designed to ignite the cables.

\subsubsection{Experiment 49}

Two nominally 30~cm (12~in) wide cable trays were set approximately 30~cm (12~in) above Enclosure~\#3. The dimensions of this enclosure are approximately 0.91~m (36~in) wide and 1.40~m (55~in) deep. Each tray overhung a louvered vent whose top edge was approximately 8~cm (3~in) below the top of the enclosure. The burner was positioned approximately 1.5~m (60~in) below the ceiling of the enclosure in the position shown in Fig.~\ref{Exp_49_diagram}. The fire was set to approximately 100~kW for 10~minutes and then increased to 200~kW for an additional 5~min. No flames were observed exiting the upper vent, and the natural gas flow was increased again to sustain a 300~kW and then 400~kW fire. However, due to ventilation limitations, the actual HRR of the fire did not surpass 200~kW, and the natural gas flow was decreased to that level. Flames were not observed exiting the vent at any time during the experiment and the target temperatures did not surpass 200~$^\circ$C.

\subsubsection{Experiment 50}

This experiment retained the same basic setup as Exp.~49 except that the louvered vent was removed leaving an approximately 20~cm (8~in) tall vent across the width of the enclosure, 8~cm (3~in) below the top. In addition, the trays were shifted so that the leftmost cable and slug targets shown in Fig.~\ref{Exp_50_diagram} would fall within the smoke plume observed in Exp.~49. However, because the vent louvers were removed, the flames and plume were thrust further to the right, and no targets were directly impacted. As a result, this experiment did not yield a meaningful target temperature at the time of ignition. It was decided after this experiment to perform the remaining experiments using a different enclosure.

Because the louvered vents were removed, the flames jetted outward such that the peak target temperatures occurred beyond the extent of the instrumented target cables and aluminum rods, as seen in the middle photograph. The bottom photograph was taken 21 minutes after ignition and shows ignition of the cables near the end of the tray.}

\subsubsection{Experiment 51}

Two cable trays were set approximately 30~cm (12~in) above Enclosure~\#2 which measured approximately 1.68~m (66~in) wide and 1.52~m (60~in) deep. Each tray overhung a grilled vent whose top edge was approximately 10~cm (4~in) below the top of the enclosure. The burner was positioned approximately 56~cm (22~in) below the ceiling of the enclosure in the position shown in Fig.~\ref{Exp_51_diagram}. The thermoset cables in the tray directly above the left upper vent ignited after approximately 18~min. The thermoplastic cables in the second tray did not ignite.

\subsubsection{Experiment 61}

This experiment used the same Enclosure~\#2 as in previous experiments, but now five approximately 11.4~cm (4.5~in) diameter holes were opened on the top of the enclosure, as shown in Fig.~\ref{Exp_61_diagram}. The same ``t-squared'' fire growth curve was used. Because three of the holes were located over the burner, and the cable tray was located above the holes, the thermoset cables ignited after approximately 10~min.

\subsubsection{Experiment 63}

This experiment was similar to Exp.~61 except that the three holes above the burner were covered with a thin sheet of steel. This sheet did not completely seal the holes, and some flames were able to pass through the gaps. Nevertheless, the shielding delayed ignition of the thermoset cables until approximately 44~min.

\subsection{Fire Penetration Through Holes in the Enclosure Top}

Experiments 65 through 83, conducted in April 2025, examined the propagation of fire from the interior to exterior of an enclosure via holes cut through the enclosure top. Figure~\ref{mock_cabinet_with_trays} displays a drawing of the assembly, which consists of steel enclosure with holes cut in its top and a gas burner placed underneath. The heat release rate of the natural gas burner was ramped up to mimic a $t$-squared profile, and various types of cables were studied. Two cable trays were positioned above the top surface. The trays contained the cables routed from the interior of the enclosure, four energized cables, two per tray, six cables instrumented with thermocouples, three per tray, and for some experiments extra cables to serve as filler.

\subsubsection{Grommets and Sealants}

The holes in the top of the mock enclosure were lined with various types of grommets, photographs of which are shown in Fig.~\ref{grommet_photo}:
\begin{description}
\item[Steel Compression Connector:] EMT (Electrical Metallic Tubing) conduit fitting with nominal inner diameters of 8.9~cm (3.5~in), 6.4~cm (2.5~in), and 3.8~cm (1.5~in) were fastened to the 10.2~cm (4~in), 7.6~cm (3~in), and 5.1~cm (2~in) diameter holes, respectively. The axial lengths of the fittings were 7.1~cm (2.8~in), 6.4~cm (2.5~in), and 4.4~cm (1.8~in). For experiments with no steel conduit, the locking rings were removed.
\item[Die Cast Zinc Compression Connector:] EMT conduit fitting with nominal inner diameter of 3.8~cm (1.5~in) fastened to the 5.1~cm (2~in) hole.
\item[Die Cast Zinc Strap Type Connector:] Nominal 3.8~cm (1.5~in) fitting fastened to the 5.1~cm (2~in) diameter hole. 
\item[Nylon Locking Grommet:] Circular ring made specifically for 4~in, 3~in, and 2~in holes.
\item[Rubber Grommet:] Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) grommets fitted in the 2~in holes. 
\item[Cut-to-Size Rubber Grommet:] Similar to the rubber grommet, but with a solid center that can be cut to size.

In some experiments, the gaps within the grommets were filled with various sealants:
\begin{description}
\item[Ceramic Fiber:] 1.3~cm (0.5~in) blanket wrapped around the cable(s) to fill the interior of the steel compression connectors. It is sold under the trade name Superwool$^{\textregistered}$ Plus Blanket by Morgan Advanced Materials.
\item[Fire-Rated Gap Filling Foam:] Gap sealing foam sold under the trade name Loctite$^{\textregistered}$ Fire Block Foam. It is designed for high temperature applications.
\item[High Density Gap Filling Foam:] Gap sealing foam sold under the trade name Loctite$^{\textregistered}$ Tite Foam Big Gaps. This product is designed for sealing gaps and cracks in common building materials. It is not designed for high temperature applications.
\item[Oil-based Duct Sealant:] A malleable putty made of non-drying synthetic polymers and oils. It is typically used to seal gaps and cracks in electrical duct work. The product used in these experiments is sold under the name Gardner Bender$^{\textregistered}$ 16-Fluid Oz.~Gray Oil Base Duct Sealant.

\section{Conclusion}

Experiments were conducted to measure the heat release rate (HRR) and burning behavior of circuit breaker fires within closed steel enclosures. Of note:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fires within compartments of the enclosure exhibited typical ``flashover'' behavior; that is, flames emerging from the opening of an under-ventilated compartment. The measured temperatures within these compartments (both gas and solid) ranged between 600~$^\circ$C and 800~$^\circ$C, typical of an uninsulated steel enclosure.
\item In the first experiment (Exp.~33) conducted in the ABB enclosure, the fire spread through double-walled steel partitions in approximately 10~min. Vigorous burning of combustibles was noted when the compartment gas temperature reached approximately 400~$^\circ$C.
\item Referring to Exp.~33 in the ABB enclosure, the combustible load within the upper compartments was sufficient to maintain a fire long enough for the neighboring compartment to heat up and burn.
\item The aluminum ``slug calorimeters'' and the interior of the instrumented cable segments exhibited similar temperatures, suggesting that the slugs might be a suitable surrogate to assess the vulnerability of electrical cables near or within a fire.
\item Using the measured mass loss of one of the breakers and estimates of the total mass consumed, a least squares regression was used to estimate the combustible mass of the ABB breaker (3.7~kg), lower compartment (3.5~kg), and upper compartment (2.7~kg). The uncertainty of these estimates is approximately 20~\%.
\item The peak HRR of a fire burning within a single compartment of the ABB enclosure is approximately 100~kW.
\end{itemize}


Experiments were also conducted to characterize the thermal environment of cables in trays above a burning electrical enclosure. For the two types of cables considered in this study, cable ignition does not occur unless they are substantially bathed within the flames of the exposing fire. The thermoplastic cable used in the experiment tends to ignite more readily than the thermoset cable, but it still requires contact with flames rather than just the hot plume.
