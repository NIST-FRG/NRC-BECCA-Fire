\section{Introduction}

Electrical enclosures housing switchgear, circuit breakers, motor controls, etc., are a common source of fire in industrial settings, and the heat release rate (HRR) of these fires is an important consideration in facility risk assessments. Previous experiments have been conducted to determine peak heat release rate (HRR) probability distributions for electrical enclosure fires~\cite{NUREG/CR-7197}. Analysis was then conducted to refine these results to consider specific electrical enclosure characteristics (e.g., cabinets size or fuel loading)~\cite{NUREG-2178}. Further experiments were conducted to measure the HRR for enclosures with limited ventilation~\cite{OLIVE-FIRE}. To date, there are few measurements of the HRR of circuit breaker fires in electrical enclosures, which have been observed to grow and continue burning for tens of minutes after high energy arc fault (HEAF) events. Thus, the experiments described in this report seek to quantify the peak HRR, time to peak HRR, and duration of circuit breaker fires in steel electrical enclosures.


\section{Description of Experiments}

Four low voltage circuit breaker enclosures were shipped to the National Fire Research Laboratory (NFRL) at NIST in September 2023. These enclosures were taken from a decommissioned nuclear power plant in Germany, and included low voltage circuit breakers and various types of wires, cables, and instrumentation manufactured by ABB. Three of enclosures were bolted together, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Cabinet_1} and one was stand-alone (Fig.~\ref{fig:Cabinet_2}). Each enclosure consisted of three vertical compartments, separated (but not fully sealed/enclosed) by horizontal metal dividing barriers.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{../FIGURES/Large_Cabinet}
\caption[Photograph of three-breaker enclosure] {Photograph of three-breaker enclosure. The breaker is located in the middle compartment of each column. Wiring and other electrical equipment is located mainly in the compartment above, and the compartment below is largely empty. Each of the three vertical columns is largely the same.}
\label{fig:Cabinet_1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{../FIGURES/Small_Cabinet}
\caption[Photograph of single-breaker enclosure] {Photograph of single-breaker enclosure.}
\label{fig:Cabinet_2}
\end{figure}

In each experiment, a low voltage circuit breaker with nominal dimensions of 30~cm by 40~cm by 30~cm and mass 47~kg was the primary combustible whose non-metallic mass consists of polymeric insulating materials such as glass-polyester and thermoset composite resins. Additionally, panels, wiring, and circuit boards were found mainly in the compartment above the breaker, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:Contents}. The compartment below the breaker was largely empty of combustibles. No attempt was made to remove and weigh the instrumentation because doing so would have potentially changed its burning behavior. However, estimates of its mass were made by dividing the integral of the heat release rate with time (kJ) by an estimated heat of combustion (kJ/kg). These estimates are entered in Table~\ref{matrix}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{../FIGURES/Contents}
\caption[Photograph of instrumentation above the breaker] {Photograph of instrumentation above the breaker. A few cables have been added to replace those removed previously.}
\label{fig:Contents}
\end{figure}

The breakers were ignited using a 30~cm square natural gas burner positioned approximately 20~cm beneath the circuit breaker, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Burner}. The burner's heat release rate\footnote{The relative expanded uncertainty (95~\% confidence interval) of the heat release rate measurement under the hood used in these experiments is 4~\% for natural gas and 7~\% for ``generic combustibles''~\cite{bryant2019nist}.} was set to approximately 100~kW. After sustained ignition of the circuit breaker was observed, the burner was turned off and the enclosure fire was allowed to continue burning until the measured heat release rate decreased below 10~kW, at which point the small remaining fires were extinguished.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{../FIGURES/Burner}
\caption[Position of the burner] {Position of the burner under the breaker in Test~2.}
\label{fig:Burner}
\end{figure}

Sheathed thermocouples (K-type, sheath diameter 3~mm) were installed 15~cm (6~in) below the ceiling of each compartment to provide a measurement of the gas temperature within. Thermocouples were also embedded within representative items (``slugs'') that were placed directly above each circuit breaker: 7-conductor thermoplastic electrical cable segments and 6061~aluminum alloy rods, both approximately  15~cm (6~in) in length and 13~mm in diameter. The heat capacity of these objects can be expressed in terms of the product of their density, specific heat, and cross sectional area, $\rho c A$, in units of kJ/K/m; that is, the amount of energy required to raise a 1~m segment 1~K. The heat capacity of the aluminum rod is approximately 0.31~kJ/K/m and the cable segment is approximately 0.36~kJ/K/m. Figure~\ref{oven} displays the measured temperature of each when placed in a convection oven whose temperature was raised to 300~$^\circ$C.

\end{figure}

An IR camera provided a qualitative measure of temperature distribution across the enclosure walls.

Photographs of the enclosures used in this work are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:Cabinet_1} and \ref{fig:Cabinet_2}. Each enclosure is approximately 2.2~m (87~in) tall, 0.4~m (16~in) wide, and 1.0~m (40~in) deep. Some of the enclosures have ventilation panels near the top and bottom, and all have seams and small openings to accommodate wiring, bus bars, door panels, and so on. No attempt was made to seal these various gaps and openings except in Experiment~2 where a burned out instrument panel was covered by a steel plate, and in Experiment~3, where a hole in the top of the enclosure was covered by a steel plate.

\section{Experimental Results}

The experiments were conducted in October of 2023. Nominal results are listed in Table~\ref{matrix} and details can be found on the following pages. For each experiment, the nominally 100~kW natural gas burner was sustained until it appeared that the breaker had begun to burn. For the first two experiments, the burner was sustained longer than necessary, as evidenced by the third experiment where the breaker was able to sustain a fire after four minutes of exposure from the burner.

The ``Peak HRR'' in Table~\ref{matrix} indicates the maximum value of the heat release rate of the enclosure contents; that is the total heat release rate minus that of the natural gas burner. The ``Total HR'' (Total Heat Release) is the total energy released less the burner's energy; that is, the energy of the contents alone. The ``Mass Consumed'' is the Total HR divided by an estimated heat of combustion of 25~MJ/kg for the combustible materials within the enclosure. The peak ``slug'' and gas temperatures are comparable and represent uniform conditions within the burning breaker and instrument compartments.

\end{table}

The breaker that was burned in Exp.~3 was weighed before and after the experiment. Its original mass was 47.8~kg and its final mass was 44.1~kg. The uncertainty of the load cell is approximately 1~g, which is far exceeded by the uncertainty due to extracting the burned breaker from the enclosure and separating out materials that were or were not part of the original breaker. Thus, the estimated combustible mass of the breaker is taken as 3.7~kg~$\pm$~0.1~kg.

Using the measured mass loss of the breaker and the estimates of the mass consumed in the three experiments, it is possible to estimate the distribution of combustible mass in the lower, middle, and upper compartments of the enclosure. In Exp.~1, the fire consumed the contents of a lower, middle and three upper compartments. In Exp.~2, the fire consumed a lower and middle compartment. In Exp.~3, the fire consumed a lower, middle, and upper compartment. Taking the combustible load of the middle compartment to be 3.7~kg, the estimated mass loss of the breaker, a least squares regression yields an estimate of 3.5~kg for the lower compartment and 2.7~kg for the upper. The 3.5~kg estimate for the lower compartment can be taken as all of the combustibles in the lower and middle compartment minus the breaker itself. These estimated combustible loads fall well within the uncertainty bounds for the total mass consumption listed in Table~\ref{matrix}.

The heat release rate of a fire contained within a single compartment is limited by the air supplied through openings in the back and side of the enclosure and the opening in the front door of the compartment that is created when the instrument panel melts/burns away. For the enclosures tested, this opening is approximately 15~cm (6~in) wide by 30~cm (12~in) tall. A useful correlation~\cite{SFPE:Walton} used in compartment fire modeling states that air is entrained into a flashed over compartment at a rate given by
\begin{equation}
   \dot{m}_{\rm a} = 0.5  \, A \, \sqrt{H}  \approx 0.0123 \; \hbox{kg/s}
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the opening height (0.3~m) and $A$ is the opening area (0.045~m$^2$). With this estimate, the heat release rate can be estimated 
\begin{equation}
   \dot{Q} = Y_{\rm O_2,\infty} \, E \, \dot{m}_{\rm a} \approx 37 \; \hbox{kW}
\end{equation}
where $Y_{\rm O_2,\infty}\approx 0.23$ is the oxygen mass fraction of air and $E\approx 13\,100$~kJ/kg is the amount of energy released per unit mass oxygen consumed. The other openings at the back and side of the enclosure supply the extra air needed to raise the heat release rate to, at most, approximately 100~kW.

\subsection{Experiment 1}

The natural gas burner was positioned near the top of the lower left compartment of the large enclosure, approximately 20~cm (8~in) below the breaker. The fire ignited the breaker after approximately 2~min and then spread to the compartment above. As evidenced by the compartment temperatures shown in the upper right plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:Test_1}, the fire then spread to the two adjacent compartments along the top of the enclosure. The gas temperatures shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Test_1} indicate that the fire spread from one compartment to the next in approximately 10~min. The compartments are separated by two steel walls. Photographs of the experiment are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Test_1_photos}.

\subsection{Experiment 2}

The fire in Exp.~1 consumed all of the combustibles in the upper compartments of the large enclosure. However, the breakers in the center and right columns remained intact. For Exp.~2, the burner was placed beneath the right breaker with the aim of measuring its heat release rate with no combustibles in the compartment above the breaker. The gas temperature in the compartment above reaches only approximately 400~$^\circ$C because there is no significant fire in this compartment, only the heat from below.

\subsection{Experiment 3}

This experiment was conducted within the single-column breaker enclosure, where the burner was positioned as in the previous experiments. The breaker ignited within 4~min at which time the burner was turned off. The HRR dropped down to about 50~kW at this time and then slowly increased as the fire spread from the breaker to the compartment above after approximately 18~min from the start of the experiment.

\section{Conclusion}

Experiments were conducted to measure the heat release rates (HRR) and burning behavior of circuit breaker fires within closed steel enclosures. Of note:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fires within compartments of the enclosure resembled typical  ``flashover'' behavior; that is, flames emerging from the openings left behind after the instrument panels melted away. The measured temperatures within these compartments (both gas and solid) ranged between 600~$^\circ$C and 800~$^\circ$C, typical of an uninsulated steel enclosure.
\item In Experiment~1, the fire spread through double-walled steel partitions in approximately 10~min. Vigorous burning of combustibles was noted when the compartment gas temperature reached approximately 400~$^\circ$C.
\item The combustible load within the upper compartments was sufficient to maintain a fire long enough for the neighboring compartment to heat up and burn.
\item The aluminum ``slug calorimeters'' and the interior of the instrumented cable segments exhibited similar temperatures, suggesting that the slugs might be a suitable surrogate to assess the vulnerability of electrical cables near or within a fire.
\item Using the measured mass loss of one of the breakers and estimates of the total mass consumed, a least squares regression was used to estimate the combustible mass of the breaker (3.7~kg), lower compartment (3.5~kg), and upper compartment (2.7~kg). The uncertainty of these estimates is approximately 20~\%.
\item The peak heat release rate of a fire burning within a single compartment of the enclosure is approximately 100~kW. 
\end{itemize}
