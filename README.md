# NRC-BECCA-Fire
This repository stores the results of experiments whose objective is to measure the heat release rates (HRR) and qualitatively understand the burning behavior of circuit breaker fires within closed steel enclosures when ignited by a source representative of a high energy arc fault (HEAF). 

The experimental data is in the DATA folder, listed by test number from 33 to 64. 

The photos and miscellaneous figures are in the FIGURES folder.

The plots that are generated by Matlab scripts in the SCRIPTS folder are stored in the SCRIPT_FIGURES folder.

The LaTeX test report is in DOCUMENTS.
